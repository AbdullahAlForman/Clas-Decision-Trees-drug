# Decision Trees for Drug Classification  

This project showcases the implementation of **Decision Tree Classification** to predict drug types based on patient attributes. By leveraging the power of `scikit-learn`, the project explores how decision trees can handle categorical and numerical data effectively.  

## 📚 Key Highlights  
- **Data Preparation:** Processes a healthcare dataset containing patient characteristics (age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels) and drug types.  
- **Decision Tree Implementation:** Builds and visualizes decision tree models for classification tasks.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Measures the accuracy of the trained model to ensure reliable predictions.  
- **Tree Visualization:** Demonstrates the structure of the decision tree for interpretability.  

## 🚀 Quick Start  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`  

Install dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### Steps to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahAlForman/Decision-Trees-Drug-Classification.git
   cd Decision-Trees-Drug-Classification
   ```  

2. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Class-Decision-Trees-drug.ipynb
   ```  

3. Execute the cells step-by-step to build the model and analyze results.  

## 📊 Project Workflow  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes the features and their relationships with drug types.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Encodes categorical variables and splits data into training and testing sets.  
3. **Model Training:** Trains a decision tree classifier using the `sklearn` library.  
4. **Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluates model performance and visualizes the decision tree structure.  

## 🏆 Results  
- Achieved a high classification accuracy on the test set.  
- Generated an intuitive decision tree for identifying patterns in the data.
